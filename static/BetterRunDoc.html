     <h3>Introduction</h3>

     <p>Like many others looking to stay in shape and get our minds off the daunting reality of the Covid-19 pandemic, I took up running (or perhaps awkwardly bumbling) as a key hobby and pastime. Living in the Bay area gives you the privilege of massive national parks, beautiful views and several different climates for all your running needs. Like many others however, running progressed from a pastime to a passion, and I always try to find a way to make myself a more efficient runner.</p>

     <h3>Market Need</h3>

    <h4>"In the United States alone, almost 60 million people participated in running, jogging and trail running in 2017. Walking for fitness drew more than 110 million participants in the U.S. in 2017. "</h4>
     
        <p>With nearly 60 million people running a year, with a certain increase from the 2017 data shown above, a niche market has developed. Running shoes are a popular consumer good, with specialized brands like Brooks, Asics and Hoka garnering cult followings. This leads us to a pain point. One of the initial problems with running is the ease of injury - although our bodies evolved to run long distances, as evident from our developed Gluteus Maximus, the Harvard Gazette estimates that nearly 35-75% of all runners get hurt every year, while Yale Medicine estimates a baseline of at-least 50%. This instantly sparked my interest, and was supported by my own anecdotal data of pain while running up and down the hills of San Jose. However, what exactly causes this pain that a large majority of runners feel?</p>

     <img src="Running Injuries.svg">

    <h3>What Causes them?</h3>

    <img src="G analysis.jpg">

    <p>Much of running is from over use - while your cardiovascular stamina feels like it can go more and more after a couple weeks of jogging, your body might not be ready for it yet, and you are likely to get an injury that sidelines you. However, one of the most important and overlooked parts of running is form. Pronation and Supination are common problem with newbie runners who don't look at form yet are eager to try long distances and push themselves.</p>

    <h3> Bringing Gait Analysis to an iPhone - Applied Market Need</h3>

    <p>Gait Analysis is the study of running form and movement to diagnose possible areas of pain and inefficiency. Truly, those who do run frequently, or even those who experience pain when they walk should try to get this done. There is a significant barrier of entry however, with a price tag of 200$ to have a technician see your running form. Now imagine we could instead use your phone to be able to bring a cost free option to every passionate runner's pocket, and potentially avoid thousands of running-related injuries every year.</p>

    <h3> User Research</h3>

    
    <img src="Screen Shot 2020-10-02 at 9.38.38 AM.png" style="max-width: 60%;">
    <img src="Screen Shot 2020-10-02 at 9.37.35 AM.png"style="max-width: 60%;">
    <img src="Screen Shot 2020-10-02 at 9.36.57 AM.png"style="max-width: 60%;">
    <img src="Screen Shot 2020-10-02 at 9.37.12 AM.png"style="max-width: 60%;">
    <img src="Screen Shot 2020-10-02 at 9.41.29 AM.png"style="max-width: 60%;">

     





    <p>The user research shows that the initial hypothesis about runners getting injured often is true - 88.6% of our potential users experience pain after running. The aspect that intrigued me is about Gait Analysis - the overwhelming majority - 95.6% have not had gait analysis performed, and about 2/3 do not know what Gait Analysis even is. This can inform our decision to add an information section into our app as that would allow runners to get educated on form errors and hopefully lower injuries.</p>

    <p>The majority of runners experience pain in multiple areas while running, and create a niche market for a tech solution to a problem in biomechanics.</p>
    <img src="BR User Personas.svg" style="max-width: 60%;">
    <h3>Initial Ideation</h3>

    <img src="Ideation Frame.svg" >

    <p>The main premise of this idea is using technology to be able to perform gait analysis on your iPhone. Formal gait analysis is usually conducted using slow motion camera, or even previously done through the naked eye spotting errors. Phone cameras have made considerable advancements in recent years, so diverting this technology push into a product to hit the market is our project.

       <br> <br>A way to market this product is to push it as a Running Coach rather than a tool for gait analysis as it is easier to consume.</p>

    <h3>Using TensorFlow Pose Estimate to create our Model</h3>
    <p>Thankfully, our job becomes much easier due to Googles Open-source machine learning tool TensorFlow, which has a pre-trained model that fits our needs - Pose Estimate. </p>

    <h3>Early Wireframes</h3>
        <img src="Wireframes.svg"style="max-width: 20%;">
    <p>These wireframes show the basic user flow captured here. The nav bar communicates the active state through a hovering status of the nav icon, with 3 main points of navigation - where you scan and conduct gait analysis, an area to access old scans and learn about common running injuries and a training section with respect to the gait of the user.</p>

    <h3>Converting an Idea into High Fidelity Prototypes</h3>

    <p>From the wireframes above, we can create high fidelity prototypes using figma. The onboarding process is highlighted in the userflow below.</p>
    <img src="Basic Flow.gif" style="max-width: 50%;" >
    <p>The normal functional flow is defined in the gif below:</p>
    <img src="Onboarding.gif"style="max-width: 50%;">
    <p>As seen in this basic user flow, the three functional points of navigation is where the user scans their gait, where the user can train effectively and safely, and where the user can learn about potential errors in their running. I also included a point of monetization with a premium version of the app in accordance to Apple's App Store guidelines.</p>

    <h3>Implementation and Roadmap to Market</h3>
